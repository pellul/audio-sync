An audio player allowing you switch tracks keeping the same timestamp.

ðŸ”€
[Example](https://github.com/pellul/audio-sync/examples/index.html)

## Usage

```html
<script src="syncaudio.js"></script>
<script>
  audioSync([
    ['file-a.mp3', 'track1-A'],
    ['file-b.mp3', 'track1-B'],
    ['file-c.mp3', 'track1-C']
  ]);
</script>
```

### Instanciation

To instanciate a new player, use the provided `audioSync()` method.

This method needs an array of couples `[fileLocation, element]` with
***fileLocation*** being a *string*, and ***element*** being any
[HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) or
a string of the targeted HTMLElement *id*.

#### Example

```javascript
audioSync([
  // 'track-en' will be converted to document.getElementById('track-en')
  ['english-version.mp3', 'track-en'],
  ['french-version.mp3', document.getElementById('track-fr')]
]);
```

### Controls

Clicking an element while its track is `paused` will start `playing` it and will
pause all the other tracks (and the all the other audio players instances with
it).

Clicking an element while its track is `playing` will pause it.

### Bindings

The HTMLElement is bound to the track once the track has finished loading.

Once all the tracks are available and ready to play, the player is set to
**ready** and thus make it controllable.

If one of the track fails loading, then no binding occurs.

### Customization

The HTMLElements will receive a class when its bound track state changes.

| Class     |  When                      |
| :-------- | :------------------------- |
| `loading` | The track is being fetched |
| `paused`  | The track is not playing   |
| `playing` | The track is playing       |
| `failed`  | An error has occured*      |

\**This might happen when the sound file is not reachable or readable*

### Browser Compatibility and File Format Support

#### Retrocompatibility

Under the hood, audio-sync is using browser's native
[HTMLAudioElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement)
to play the tracks.\
audio-sync *should* support IE9 and every recent browser (tests required).\
